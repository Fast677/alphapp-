        Test the log entry creation and output for the succeeded module.

        This test verifies that the log entry is correctly created with a fixed timestamp
        and that it is written to the file and printed to the console as expected.

        Args:
            mock_datetime (Mock): Mock object for datetime to control the current time.
            mock_file (Mock): Mock object for the file to verify the log entry writing.

        Steps:
        1. Set up a fixed timestamp using the mock_datetime object.
        2. Import the succeeded module.
        3. Verify that the log entry is written to the file with the expected content.
        4. Verify that the log entry is printed to the console with the expected content.
